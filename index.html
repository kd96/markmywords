## K, What is this thing?
MarkMyWords is a browser based tool to help you create nicely formatted documents real fast. On the right pane, you write in 'Markdown' and on the left you see the formatted text. It's a pretty quick and neat arrangement. You can use it for quickly writing up reports, assignments, letters, whatever.

## How do I write in markdown?
Its just like normal typing, except you use special symbols to indicate that certain text has to be formatted as a heading, or shown in bold text etc. As you'd have seen by now on the right pane, starting a line with '#' makes the line title of the page, and having '##' makes the line a heading. Here is a whole list of things you can do with this:

- Headings
- Emphasis
- Lists
- Links and Images
- Tables
- References
- Blockquotes
- Code

### Headings

- Use one # to insert a title:
# Title!
- Use two ## to insert a heading:
## Heading like this
- Use three ### to insert subheading:
### Subheading here
- Use four #### to insert sub-subheading:
#### Sub-subheading looks like this

### Emphasis
#### Italic text
Enclose some text between a set of * to make it italics, *like this*.

#### Bold text
Use two ** instead of one * to make it bold, **like this**.

#### Bold and italics
Use three ***, ***like this***.

#### Highlighted text
Use two ==, ==like this.==

#### Strikethrough
Use two ~~, to ~~strike out text~~

#### Superscript
Use ^, ^likethis^

#### Subscript
Use ~, ~likethis~

### Lists
You can have unordered lists or ordered lists.

#### Unordered lists
For unordered lists, start each list item with * :
* Red
* Green
* Blue

#### Ordered lists
For ordered lists, you use numbers followed by a dot(.):
1. Red
2. Green
3. Blue


### Links and images
You can link using [ link text here ] and ( link url here ), [like this](http://example.com).

Images can be inserted from links using ! [ alt text here ] ( image link here ), as shown below:
![alt text](https://picsum.photos/200/100?image=0)

### Tables
For inserting tables, each line is a row, and column entries are enclosed between '|'. There is line of hyphens after the header row. An example is shown below:
|Sl. No.|Item|Price|
|:-----:|:---|:---:|
|1|Mutton Biriyani|200|
|2|Chicken Biriyani|150|
|3| Veg. Pulao|100|

As you can observe, colons (:) can be used to align text in columns to left, center or right.

### References
You can cite references using [] and ^, like this, [^refname1]. You can provide footnotes later using the reference name you entered here.

### Blockquotes

> Start with a '>' to create a box like this.

### Code
Enclose code between two lines of ```, like this
```
a = 'this is code'
b = 6
```

### References list
[^refname1]: Footnote for refname1
